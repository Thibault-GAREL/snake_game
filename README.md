## 📝 Project Description 
This project is a **classic Snake game** built with Pygame.  
You can play manually, or let the snake move automatically with random actions.  

The game also provides detailed **distance calculations** to food and walls (in all 8 directions).  
These metrics are useful for **training AI agents** later on, such as [Snake AI - GA](https://github.com/Thibault-GAREL/AI_snake_genetic_version) and [Snake AI - DQL](https://github.com/Thibault-GAREL/AI_snake_DQN_version).

## ⚙️ Features
  🎮 Playable Snake game with smooth movement  

  🍎 Food spawning and snake growth  

  🟩 Detailed snake rendering (head, body, tail with unique visuals)  

  📏 Functions to compute distances to **walls** and **food** in all directions (N, S, E, W, NE, NW, SE, SW)  

  🤖 Option to toggle **player mode** or **random agent mode**  

  🖼️ Optional checkerboard display for debugging

## ⚙️ How it works

  🕹️ Control the snake manually with the arrow keys (**UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT**) or let the random agent play.  

  🍎 When the snake eats food, it grows by 1 segment and new food is generated.  

  💥 Collision with walls or itself ends the game.  

  📊 Extra functions calculate distances to walls and food, allowing the game to be used as an environment for AI.  

---

## 🗺️ Schema  
💡 The snake is represented as a list of `Snake` objects, while food is a simple `food` object.  
The environment provides **distance functions** that can be reused in AI or reinforcement learning projects.
